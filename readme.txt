Adds a new button to the post and page editing TinyMCE toolbar (though only in
visual/rich editing mode) for creating tag, category and author links to highlighted text.

== Description ==
This plugin will add a new button to the post and page editing TinyMCE toolbar (though only in
visual/rich editing mode). Highlight text and click the main button and it will make that text
a tag link to your blog, or you can click the submenu to choose from your site's category links
or links to authors (only those who are currently set as "contributor" or higher).

== Installation ==

Activate in plugins admin screen. No options available.

If you wish to make all users available for linking in the "Authors" submenu, you'll need to
change one simple line in one of the source files.

== ChangeLog ==

1.0 - Initial release.

1.1 - Fixed path to plugin location.
